 * @Title: GObject integration
 * @short_description: Types for GObject properties and signals
 *
 * Graphene optionally provides information for using its own types with
 * GObject properties and signals.
 *
 * ## Using Graphene with GObject
 *
 * In order to discover at compile time if Graphene exposes type information
 * for the GType type system, you need to check if the `graphene-gobject-1.0`
 * pkg-config file exists. In build systems using autotools, you can use
 * the `PKG_CHECK_EXISTS` m4 macro, for instance:
 *
 * |[
 *   PKG_CHECK_EXISTS([graphene-gobject-1.0],
 *                    [action-if-found],
 *                    [action-if-not-found]
 * ]|
 *
 * All the types provided by Graphene are boxed types, which means you
 * will have to use the #GBoxed API when dealing with #GValue, #GParamSpec,
 * and signal marshallers.
 *
 * Graphene type names for use in GObject are the camel case version of
 * the C name, minus the `_t` suffix; for instance:
 *
 *  * #graphene_point_t becomes `GraphenePoint`
 *  * #graphene_point3d_t becomes `GraphenePoint3D`
 *  * #graphene_rect_t becomes `GrapheneRect`
 *  * #graphene_matrix_t becomes `GrapheneMatrix`
 *
 * There is no direct access for the low level #graphene_simd4f_t and
 * #graphene_simd4x4f_t SIMD types.
